# React-Portfolio

The challenge in this project was to create a portfolio, using React and the application is to be deployed on GitHub pages.

# A) The user story for this project was:

AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications

I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples

SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

# B) The Acceptance Criteria for the project was:

GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer

WHEN I load the portfolio

THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer

WHEN I view the header

THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio

WHEN I view the navigation titles

THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted

WHEN I click on a navigation title

THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted

WHEN I load the portfolio the first time

THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default

WHEN I am presented with the About Me section

THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them

WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section

THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository

WHEN I am presented with the Contact section

THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message

WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text

THEN I receive a notification that this field is required

WHEN I enter text into the email address field

THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address

WHEN I am presented with the Resume section

THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies

WHEN I view the footer

THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)

# C) The expected appearance and functionality of the app is demonstrated by the mock-up below:
